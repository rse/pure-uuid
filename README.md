Abstract
--------

This is a pure JavaScript and dependency-free library for the generation
of DCE 1.1, ISO/IEC 11578:1996 and IETF RFC-4122 compliant Universally
Unique Identifier (UUID). It supports DCE 1.1 variant UUIDs of version
1 (time and node based), version 3 (name based, MD5), version 4 (random
number based) and version 5 (name based, SHA-1). It can be used in both
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) based server and browser based client
environments.

The essential points of this implementation (in contrast to the many
others) are: First, although internally 32/64 bit unsigned integer
arithmentic and MD5/SHA-1 digest algorithmic is required, this UUID
implementation is fully self-contained and dependency-free. Second,
this implementation wraps around either `Uint8Array`, `Buffer` or
`Array` standard classes and this way tries to represent UUIDs as best
as possible in the particular environment. Third, thanks to a Universal
Module Definition (UMD) wrapper, this library works out-of-the-box in
all important JavaScript run-time environments.

What is a UUID?
---------------

UUIDs are 128 bit numbers which are intended to have a high likelihood
of uniqueness over space and time and are computationally difficult to
guess. They are globally unique identifiers which can be locally
generated without contacting a global registration authority. UUIDs are
intended as unique identifiers for both mass tagging objects with an
extremely short lifetime and to reliably identifying very persistent
objects across a network.

### UUID Binary Representation

According to the DCE 1.1, ISO/IEC 11578:1996 and IETF RFC-4122
standards, a DCE 1.1 variant UUID is a 128 bit number defined out of 7
fields, each field a multiple of an octet in size and stored in network
byte order:

An example of a UUID binary representation is the octet stream 0xF8
0x1D 0x4F 0xAE 0x7D 0xEC 0x11 0xD0 0xA7 0x65 0x00 0xA0 0xC9 0x1E 0x6B
0xF6.

### UUID ASCII String Representation

According to the DCE 1.1, ISO/IEC 11578:1996 and IETF RFC-4122
standards, a DCE 1.1 variant UUID is represented as an ASCII string
consisting of 8 hexadecimal digits followed by a hyphen, then three
groups of 4 hexadecimal digits each followed by a hyphen, then 12
hexadecimal digits.

    fold(k: number): number[];
}

export interface UUIDConstructor {
  /*  default construction  */
  new(): UUID;

  /*  parsing construction  */
  new(uuid: string): UUID;

  /*  making construction  */
  new(version: number): UUID;
  new(version: number, ns: string, data: string): UUID;

declare var UUID: UUIDConstructor;
export default UUID;
```

Examples
--------

```js
//  load a UUID
uuid = new UUID("0a300ee9-f9e4-5697-a51a-efc7fafaba67");

//  make a UUID version 1 (time and node based)
uuid = new UUID(1);

//  make a UUID version 3 (name-based, MD5)
uuid = new UUID(3, "ns:URL", "http://example.com/");

//  make a UUID version 4 (random number based)
uuid = new UUID(4);

//  make a UUID version 5 (name-based, SHA-1)
uuid = new UUID(5, "ns:URL", "http://example.com/");

//  format a UUID in standard format
str = uuid.format()
str = uuid.format("std")

//  format a UUID in Base16 format
str = uuid.format("b16")

//  format a UUID in ZeroMQ-Base85 format
str = uuid.format("z85")
```
